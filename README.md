#### Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.

I want to chronicle the existence of every Pokémon in the Kanto region.

#### Describe the solution you'd like

As a Pokemon Professor, I want a Pokédex containing the first 151 Pokemon.

#### Additional Context

The professor's assistant went ahead and did most of the heavy lifting and created the [PokéAPI](https://pokeapi.co/) for requesting all Pokémon-related data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

- A list where I can see the **name** and **number** of the first **151** Pokemon.
- Clicking a list item opens more details about the Pokemon, including:
  - The **type(s)** of the Pokemon
  - The **sprites** of the Pokemon
- Add a method to search Pokémon by name.
